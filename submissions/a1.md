## Comments for A1:
We have completed all **basic requirements**.

For **automated release process** from **versioning and releases**, we have implemented all requirements upto a *sufficient* criteria. From the *good* and *excellent* requirements, we have implemented all criteria besides:
- After a stable release, main is set to a pre-release version that is higher than the latest release.
- The released container images support multiple architectures, at least amd64 and arm64 .
- The Dockerﬁle uses multiple stages, e.g., to reduce image size by avoiding apt cache in image.

For **software reuse in libraries** from **versioning and releases**, we have implemented all requirements besides the following criteria from the *excellent* section:
- A local cache is used so the model is not just downloaded on every container start.

For **exposing a model via REST** from **containers and orchestration**, we have implemented all requirements upto a *sufficient* criteria. From the *good* and *excellent* requirements, we have we have implemented all criteria besides:
- An ENV variable deﬁnes the DNS name and port of the model-service .
- All server endpoints have a well-deﬁned API deﬁnition that follows the Open API Speciﬁcation, and documents at least a summary, the parameters, and the response.
- The listening port of the model-service can be conﬁgured through an ENV variable.

For **docker compose operation** from **containers and orchestration**,  we have implemented all requirements upto a *sufficient* criteria. From the *good* and *excellent* requirements, we have implemented all criteria besides:
- The Docker compose ﬁle uses a volume mapping, a port mapping, and an environment variable.
- The compose ﬁle works with the same images as the ﬁnal Kubernetes deployment does.
- Services have a restart policy.
- The deployment contains an example of a Docker secret.
- The deployment uses an environment ﬁle, e.g., to conﬁgure names/versions of images
